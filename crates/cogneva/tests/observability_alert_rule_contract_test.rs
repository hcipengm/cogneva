//! Every PromQL expression in the deployed alert rules reads series by name.
//!
//! A rule whose expression names a series nothing produces never fires. It does
//! not error, it does not log, it does not show up anywhere except as an alert
//! that stays quiet through exactly the incident it was written for — the same
//! failure mode the dashboard contract covers, on the side that is supposed to
//! wake someone up. The two sides drift for the same reason: nothing about
//! editing one makes the other notice.
//!
//! The dashboard contract test covers panels. This one covers
//! `observability.infra_watch.rules` in the chart, which nothing checked before.
//!
//! The tables below are the contract. A series a rule reads must be either one
//! this workspace publishes (recorded with the file that publishes it, so a
//! deleted producer fails the test) or an explicitly owned foreign series.
//! Anything unclassified fails, because the failure mode here is silence, and
//! silence is what a forgotten classification looks like.
