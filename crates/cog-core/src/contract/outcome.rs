//! Wire markers that a producer writes in-band onto a failed run's reason, so a
//! consumer that sees only the reason string can tell a deterministic failure
//! from one worth retrying.
//!
//! An empty plan and a plan whose prompt never reached its upstream look
//! identical to every downstream consumer — an empty plan is a valid plan — so
//! the cause has to travel in the reason itself. These prefixes are that
//! carrier.
//!
//! They are defined here, in the shared contract layer, because producers and
//! consumers live in different crates. A consumer that re-types the literal
//! instead of importing it keeps compiling and silently stops matching the day
//! a producer changes the wording, which is how a declared classification ends
//! up permanently empty while the corresponding events keep happening.

/// Prefix marking a run whose failure cause is deterministic (environment or
/// upstream protocol), so retry/upgrade loops can stop instead of re-paying for
/// attempts that must fail again.
